## Colour Evolution TODO

### Bugs
- [x] Prevent evolution re-run until previous has finished

### UI
- [x] Ensure initial generation is smoothly inserted onto page
- [x] Add slide down when Evolve button is clicked
- [x] Add second evolve button into scroll header
- [ ] Fix header elements being misplaced at small screen widths
- [ ] Each new row generated should smoothly slide down from parent
- [ ] Update UI to allow diagram configuration - such as cell width and generations
- [ ] Hover over a cell to display RGB colour value
- [ ] Indicator to illustrate and describe mutation event

### Evolution Functionality
- [ ] Chance of mutations occurring
- [ ] Option for two-parent generation
- [ ] Prevent CPU-bound JS loops to improve user IO experience when cells are evolving
- [ ] Should each cell be an accessor function or an object or class?

### Misc
- [x] Use Babel to compile ES6 javascript to ensure compatibility across browsers
- [ ] Use WebPack and Babel for CSS bundling
- [ ] Learn the git command line - including branches
