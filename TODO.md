## Colour Evolution TODO

### Bugs
- [x] Prevent evolution re-run until previous has finished

### UI
- [x] Ensure initial generation is smoothly inserted onto page
- [ ] Animate 'Evolve' button to reflect generation is in progress
- [ ] Each new row generated should smoothly slide down from parent
- [ ] Update UI to allow diagram configuration - such as cell width and generations
- [ ] Hover over a cell to display RGB colour value
- [ ] Indicator to illustrate and describe mutation event

### Evolution Functionality
- [ ] Chance of mutations occurring
- [ ] Option for two-parent generation
- [ ] Should each cell be an accessor function or an object or class?

### Misc
- [ ] Use Babel to compile ES6 code to ensure compatibility across browsers
- [ ] Learn the git command line - including branches
